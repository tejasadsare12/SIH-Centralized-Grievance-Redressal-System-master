# Centralized Grievance Readdressal System 

#### A solution to a Student's Voice problem in Smart India Hackathon

### SOLUTION DESCCRIPTION:

As India inches towards becoming a clean and digital country under schemes like Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and Digital India, it becomes imperative that people have convenient means of communicating their grievances related to cleanliness in their neighbourhood, overflowing drainage and garbage bins, unauthorized construction, etc. We plan to achieve this by creating a website and app, named "asar", which would be helpful for both the society and Municipal Corporations. People prefer to neglect these issues as nobody wants to spend their time standing in long queues and waiting for the authorities to address their issues. This in turn encourages the authorities to turn a blind eye to their problems. Consider a scenario where a society is facing overflowing drains and garbage bins or if there are uncovered potholes and other related issues that need immediate response. Then these problems can be directly addressed through this website or app with the help of geo-tagging facility so that authorities can efficiently locate and solve these issues with just a click. Our initiative can act as a bridge between the public and the concerned bodies. This will be very helpful for authorities also as they can have direct access to problems of society. So no queues and no negligence.
